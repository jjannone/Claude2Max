## Always Verify Against Max Documentation — Never Guess

Max is not consistent in its terminology, implementation, or formatting. Attribute names, types, value ranges, and defaults vary unpredictably between objects and even between related objects in the same family. What works for `jit.gl.text3d` may not work for `jit.gl.text`. An attribute that takes a symbol in one object takes an int in another. A value that seems obvious (`align center`) may be silently ignored because the type is wrong (`align 1`). There is no reliable pattern to reason from — the only safe source is the documentation for that exact object.

**Before using any Max object — including its attributes and messages** — look it up in the Max installation's reference files. This applies to the object itself, not just its attributes. Familiar-sounding names (`max`, `min`, `clip`) can refer to completely different things in Max than you expect.

**Step 1 — Verify the object exists and does what you want.** Use `REFPAGE_CACHE.lookup(name)`:
- If it returns `None`: the object does not exist. Stop. Find the correct object name.
- If it returns inlet/outlet counts that don't match your expectation: wrong object. Check the digest.
- Then read the `<digest>` from the refpage XML to confirm the object's purpose matches your intent.

```python
from spec2maxpat import REFPAGE_CACHE
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

r = REFPAGE_CACHE.lookup('clip')          # check exists + I/O counts
path = REFPAGE_CACHE._find_xml('clip')
digest = ET.parse(path).getroot().find('digest')
print(digest.text)                         # "Limit numbers to a range" — correct
```

**Step 2 — Verify attributes.** For every attribute you intend to use, answer all of the following from the documentation before writing code:

- **Does this attribute exist on this exact object?** (not a similar object, not a related family)
- **What is its type?** (`int`, `float`, `symbol`, `list` — this determines how to send it)
- **What are the valid values?** (enum integers? float range? specific symbols?)
- **What is the default?** (so you know what "no change" looks like)
- **Is it settable via message, or only at object creation via `@attr`?**
- **Are there any known silent-failure modes?** (wrong type → ignored with no error)

**Where to look** — all of these are in the Max installation at `/Applications/Max.app/Contents/Resources/C74/docs/refpages/`:
- `jit-ref/jit.gl.text.maxref.xml` — Jitter GL objects
- `max-ref/<object>.maxref.xml` — core Max objects
- `msp-ref/<object>.maxref.xml` — MSP signal objects
- Help patches: `/Applications/Max.app/Contents/Resources/C74/help/`
- Snippets: `/Applications/Max.app/Contents/Resources/C74/snippets/`

Use `grep` to search these files directly. A 30-second grep is always faster than three rounds of wrong guesses.

## Reasoning About Max — From Specific to General

When learning something specific about Max, immediately ask: **what category does this belong to, and does the property apply to all members of that category?**

Max has two distinct contexts that look similar but behave differently:

| Context | Format | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Stored attribute** (.maxpat JSON) | `[x, y, w, h]` | `patching_rect`, `presentation_rect` |
| **Runtime message / response** | `[x1, y1, x2, y2]` (two corners) | `getrect` response, `window_rect` notification |

The mistake to avoid: learning something about a runtime message and applying it to a stored attribute (or vice versa). These are different categories and the property does not transfer between them.

**General rule**: whenever you encounter a new Max attribute or message involving geometry, first determine which category it belongs to, then apply the property for that category — not the other one.

In the rare case where a specific instance violates a category rule, **document the exception explicitly** — name the object/attribute, state the rule it breaks, and note any known reason. An undocumented exception will be re-learned as a surprise every time.

This pattern of reasoning applies broadly in Max patching:
- Outlet indices are **0-based from the left** — true for all objects universally; no need to verify per object.
- `trigger` fires **right-to-left** — true for all `trigger` objects; if you know it for one, you know it for all.
- jit.gl objects share a **named render context** — if two objects share a context name, they render in the same world; apply this transitively when reasoning about visibility and draw order.

---

## Max .maxpat Internals

- **Z-order**: In the `boxes` array, earlier items render on top (in front). To put an object visually on top of others, place it first in the array. Background objects go last.
- **@bubbleside** (comment bubble arrows): `0=top, 1=left, 2=bottom, 3=right`. The arrow appears on that side of the comment, pointing outward. Use `"bubble_bgcolor"` (not `"bgcolor"`) for bubble background color.

## Max Patching Principles

Design-level principles derived from real patch evolution — patterns that recur across patches and should be applied proactively.

### Prefer smooth transitions over abrupt state changes
Any binary state change on a visual or audio parameter should be ramped rather than switched. The appropriate object depends on context: `line 0.` for Jitter/GL float parameters, `bline` for bounded ranges, `line~` for audio. A fade of even 500–1000 ms reads as intentional; a hard cut reads as a bug. For instance: "fade to black" is better implemented as `== 0` → `$1 1000` → `line 0.` → color message than as a direct toggle.

### Decouple human-readable labels from internal values
Controls should output human-readable labels that get translated to internal values downstream, never the reverse. This applies to any selection UI — buttons, menus, toggles. For instance: quick-select buttons output `live`, `2sec`, `4sec`; a `route` or `coll` downstream maps those to the numeric indices the rest of the patch needs. This lets you rename or reorder options without rewiring.

### Make selection state visible at the control, not just in the data
When a group of controls are mutually exclusive, the active one should be visually distinguished without relying on the user to track state mentally. In Max, `spray N` fans a signal to N outlets; send distinct `bgcolor` messages to each button — active gets highlight color, others get default. This is the idiomatic pattern for radio-button feedback.

### Set draw order explicitly — never rely on implicit ordering
Any time multiple visual elements occupy the same space, assign their render order explicitly rather than relying on patcher box order or arrival time. In Max/Jitter, `@layer` controls GL draw order: background objects get `@layer 0`, foreground objects `@layer 1` or higher. Box position in the patch does not determine what renders in front.

### Always provide a generative fallback for external media inputs
Any input that requires external media (camera, movie file, image) should have a generative fallback — `jit.noise`, a blank `jit.matrix`, or a `loadbang`-initialized default — so the patch produces visible, non-crashing output when no external source is connected. This is essential for testing and for graceful live performance recovery.

### Prefer objects designed for interactive use in live contexts
When choosing between objects with overlapping capabilities, prefer the one designed for the actual use context. For media playback in live or semi-live settings, `jit.playlist` (drag-and-drop loading, queuing, loop control) is a better fit than `jit.movie` (programmatic control). The more interactive-ready object saves wiring and handles edge cases the simpler one requires you to patch around.

### Group objects by what they act on, not by what they do
Objects that all operate on the same data belong together — in the same subpatcher or spatial cluster — even if their individual operations differ. For instance: crop, zoom, rotation, and offset all transform the same matrix; they belong in `p TRANSFORM`, not scattered across the top level. The organizing question is "what does this touch?" not "what kind of operation is this?" This makes signal flow readable and makes functional units easy to bypass or isolate.

### Every control must initialize to a known state on patch load
Any number box, toggle, or flonum added to a patch must have a `loadmess` (or `loadbang` → `message`) that fires a sensible default on load. A control without a default is a source of undefined state that reproduces inconsistently and is hard to debug.

---

## Max Patching Knowledge

- Use `loadmess` → `unpack` to distribute multiple init values to separate controls on patch load.
- When a source produces stereo output, preserve both channels through the entire chain to `dac~`/`ezdac~`. Don't merge to mono. `live.gain~` handles stereo natively (2 signal inlets, 2 signal outlets).
- Set patcher `width` and `height` large enough to contain all objects without scrolling, including info comments. Leave margin below the lowest object.
- `dialog` object (text-input prompt): `inlets=2, outlets=3`. Outlet 0 outputs the entered text as a symbol. Use `route symbol` after it to filter for the symbol type; then `prepend parsetarget` (or similar) to route to a v8 handler.
- `playlist~`: `inlets=1, outlets=3` (sig audio, sig position, int state). Send `append` to open the file chooser; send integer `1` to play the first item.
- `umenu` items in `.maxpat` format are stored as a flat token array with `","` as item separators: `["item", "one", ",", "item", "two"]`. Set via `attrs: {"items": [...]}` in the spec.
- `jit.world` window size: send `getrect` to inlet 0; response `rect x1 y1 x2 y2` (two corners, not x/y/w/h) comes out the **rightmost outlet** (not outlet 0). Spec the object with 3 outlets (`outlettype: ["", "bang", ""]`); connect outlet 2 to a `route rect` to filter the response. Compute width = x2−x1, height = y2−y1.

## Patching Layout — Avoiding Cord Tangles

When an object fans out to multiple destinations — for instance, both a processing chain and a display box — check whether placing all destinations at the same y-position will cause cords to cross. If so, stagger the destinations vertically so each incoming cord has a clear path. This is a case-by-case judgment based on the specific layout.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- `multislider` `fetch N` outputs from **outlet 1** (right), not outlet 0. A single int sent to a `multislider` sets all sliders to that value.
- `gate N`: inlet 0 = open/close control, inlet 1 = data input
- `trigger` / `t` fires outlets **right-to-left** — rightmost outlet fires first
- `makenote` needs pitch on inlet 0, velocity on inlet 1, duration on inlet 2
- For MIDI synths in Max: `makenote` → `pack` → `midiformat` → synth object
- `ezdac~` and `gain~` are their own maxclass types, not `newobj`
- Spec `size` field overrides converter defaults — use it for non-standard dimensions
- `live.gain~` with `"orientation": 1` for horizontal layout

## Presentation View Design Principles

These principles represent the preferred aesthetic and UX approach for Max presentation views. Read and treat as a checklist before starting any presentation layout.

### Action prominence hierarchy
Size communicates priority — the most-used controls must be the largest, most visually dominant elements. Secondary controls are smaller and subordinate. Never give all controls equal visual weight; the user's eye should land on the most important control first without scanning.

### Panel-based grouping
Use dark rounded panels (`panel` objects with rounded corners and a dark fill) to cluster related controls. The panel boundary is the group label — controls inside share a purpose. Do not mix unrelated controls inside one panel. Leave consistent padding (≈15 px) between panel edge and contents.

### Section headers inside panels
Place a small comment at the top-left of each panel naming the group (e.g. "capture", "playback", "output size"). Keep it brief — one short phrase. This is the panel's title, not a label for any individual control.

### Color as semantic signal
Follow this palette consistently:
- **Red** (`1. 0. 0. 1.`) — live/active state; critical or high-priority labels
- **Amber/orange** (`1. 0.55 0. 1.`) — secondary important labels; changed objects
- **Blue background** on number boxes — indicates a saved/persistent value
- **Red button** — write/store action (irreversible or important)
- **Green button** — read/recall action (safe)
- **White/light** — standard labels and controls

### Monospace font throughout
Use a monospace font (e.g. `Courier` or `Monaco`) consistently across all comment labels and UI text in presentation view. It gives a technical-but-legible character and makes the layout feel intentional.

### Label placement
Labels go to the **right** of their control — never above, never below (unless vertical stacking is forced by space). Align label baselines with the control's vertical center.

### Reset affordances co-located
Place reset buttons **inside** the panel they affect, near the bottom of the group. Never put a global reset in a utility area separate from the controls it resets.

### Preview embedded in the UI
When the patch has a live preview (camera, video, generated image), embed it in the presentation view as a `jit.pwindow` within one of the panels. Do not rely on a separate floating window.

### Store/recall isolated
Group settings persistence controls (store, recall, notes about what is saved) in their own panel, visually separated from parameter controls. This prevents accidental triggering and makes the save workflow explicit.

---

## Output-Only UI Objects

When any UI object is used purely for display (not user input), disable interaction and remove interactive visual affordances so users don't accidentally edit displayed values. For a number box: set `@ignoreclick 1` to disable interaction and `@triangle 0` to remove the edit arrow. The specific attributes vary by object type — apply the equivalent for toggles, sliders, etc.

---

## UI Layout — Label and Control Spacing

Label overflow into adjacent controls is the most common layout mistake. Follow these rules on every spec.

### Label width estimation

At Max's default font size, estimate **~7.5 px per character + 8 px padding** (round up generously). If using a monospace font such as Courier or Monaco, use **~8.5 px per character + 8 px padding** — monospace fonts are wider and labels will collide if you use the default estimate:

| Label text length | Estimated width |
|------------------|----------------|
| 4–5 chars ("CLEAR", "SIZE") | ~48 px |
| 6–7 chars ("EXPORT", "LABELS") | ~60 px |
| 8–9 chars ("GENERATE", "FONTSIZE") | ~74 px |
| 10–13 chars ("COLOR SCHEME", "FONT SIZE") | ~100 px |

### Horizontal spacing rule for a row of labeled controls

```
next_x = prev_x + max(prev_label_width, prev_control_width) + 20
```

Always compute this left-to-right before placing any object. Never eyeball it.

### Message box width

Max auto-sizes message boxes to fit their text. Use `size` to fix widths explicitly when placing them in a row:

- "bang" → 40 px
- "clear", "export" → 50 px
- "exportpanel", "importpanel" → 82 px
- Default minimum: 50 px

### Routing object widths (prepend, loadmess, pack, etc.)

These sit below visible controls and overlap silently if columns are too close.

Estimated widths (text chars × 7.5 + 14 px, +15% safety margin):

| Object text | Estimated width |
|-------------|----------------|
| `prepend colorscheme` | 155 px |
| `prepend showlabels` | 150 px |
| `prepend fontsize` | 130 px |
| `prepend bang` | 85 px |
| `loadmess 1` | 80 px |
| `loadmess 11` | 85 px |
| `print name` | 80–95 px |

**Rule:** when routing objects for adjacent columns sit at the same `y`, confirm:
```
col[n+1].x  ≥  col[n].x + routing_object_width[n] + 15
```

### Content-driven sizing

Size controls and UI elements based on their content, not the patch window. The window should adapt to the content — not the other way around.

- **Multislider**: width = `step_count × 40–50 px` (40px/step is the usable minimum; 50px is comfortable for editing). For an 8-step sequencer: 8 × 50 = 400 px. Never derive width from the patcher window size.
- **jsui / jit.pwindow / textedit**: size for expected content, leaving at least 20–30 px margin on each side. A 560 × 340 jsui in a 740 px patch reads better than one that nearly touches both edges.

### Title comments

Do **not** add a `comment` object whose text simply restates the patch name. The patch name already appears in Max's title bar. Only add a title comment when the patch name alone doesn't convey what the patch does, or when the patch will be embedded as a subpatcher (where the title bar isn't visible).

The converter automatically generates a title comment from the spec's `name` field — do **not** also add an explicit title object (e.g. `lbl_title`) in the spec's `objects` map. Doing so creates two title comments in the patch.

### Standard column offsets for a 3-column parameter row

For a row of three labeled controls (e.g., scheme menu + toggle + number box) in a 740 px patch:

- Column A: `x = 10`  (umenu / wide control + `prepend colorscheme` ending ≈ x=165)
- Column B: `x = 180` (toggle / narrow control + `prepend showlabels` ending ≈ x=330)
- Column C: `x = 355` (number box + `prepend fontsize` ending ≈ x=485)
- Utility objects (print, etc.): `x = 495`

Adjust proportionally for narrower patches.

### Loadmess init chains

Prefer the shortest chain: `loadmess` → UI control (toggle, number box) → the control fires and propagates through its prepend → jsui. Do **not** also wire `loadmess` directly to the prepend — that double-fires the init message.

### Presentation rect format

After converting, post-process the .maxpat to add `presentation_rect` to each presented box. Write it as **`[x, y, w, h]`** — same format as `patching_rect`, not two corners. (Note: `getrect` *responses* use two corners `x1 y1 x2 y2`, but JSON storage attributes always use `x y w h`.)
